## üìñ Introduction

**BridgeGPT** is the first domain-specific fine-tuned large language model specialized for bridge engineering. BridgeGPT and its training methodology are presented in **[ACL'25] SDBench: A Survey-based Domain-specific LLM Benchmarking and Optimization Framework**.

## üèóÔ∏è Applications

We have developed an **Automated Bridge Maintenance LLM Framework** based on BridgeGPT, featuring two main applications:

### 1. ü§ñ Data-Knowledge Dual-Driven Intelligent Q&A

![Data-Knowledge Q&A Demo](/BridgeGPT_QA_demo.gif)

Our bridge maintenance LLM seamlessly integrates with knowledge bases and databases to retrieve relevant information and provide contextually accurate answers tailored to real-world scenarios. This dual-driven approach ensures responses are both theoretically sound and practically applicable.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time knowledge base retrieval
- Database query integration
- Context-aware response generation
- Multi-source information synthesis

### 2. üîç Bridge Defect Detection & Report Generation

![Defect Detection Demo](/BridgeGPT_M_demo.gif)

We've trained a specialized small model for bridge defect detection using open-source datasets and integrated it into the BridgeGPT workflow. This enables BridgeGPT to automatically perform:

- **Problem Classification**: Automatically categorize different types of bridge defects
- **Data Processing**: Handle and preprocess inspection data
- **Result Analysis**: Provide a comprehensive analysis of detected issues
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed inspection reports

This integrated solution significantly optimizes bridge maintenance workflows by automating time-consuming manual processes.

    abstract = "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has made it feasible to establish domain-specific LLMs for specialized fields. However, in practical development, acquiring domain-specific knowledge often requires a significant amount of professional expert manpower. Moreover, even when domain-specific data is available, the lack of a unified methodology for benchmark dataset establishment often results in uneven data distribution. This imbalance can lead to an inaccurate assessment of the true model capabilities during the evaluation of domain-specific LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce **SDBench**, a generic framework for generating evaluation datasets for domain-specific LLMs. This method is also applicable for establishing the LLM instruction datasets. It significantly reduces the reliance on expert manpower while ensuring that the collected data is uniformly distributed. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we also present the **BridgeBench**, a novel benchmark for bridge engineering knowledge, and the **BridgeGPT**, the first LLM specialized in bridge engineering, which can solve bridge engineering tasks."
